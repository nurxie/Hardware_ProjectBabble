these models are still in need of improvement. 
They can be printed on a regular 3D printer, 
I tested printing with PLA plastic.

I don't really like the attachment element 
that needs to be glued to the helmet itself. 
But this is the most versatile. 
In the future, I will add a separate 
custom element for each helmet.
